/**
 * === CS3114 Project 2 - DNA Trees ===
 *

 * 
 * == DESCRIPTION ==
 * 
 * This program stores, searches, and outputs DNA sequences in a DNA Tree data
 * structure. The DNA tree is a 5-way branching tree wherein DNA sequences are
 * stored in the tree's leaf nodes.
 * 
 * There are 3 types of Nodes: InternalNode, SequenceLeafNode, EmptyLeafNode
 * 
 * InternalNodes - This node has 5 children nodes; one for each character of the
 * DNA alphabet, A, C, G, T. The remaining child can store a sequence that is a
 * prefix to the other sequence in the node. Moreover, InternalNodes that store
 * a prefix, may contain only 1 other child.
 * 
 * EmptyLeafNode - This node implements a flyweight design. A single
 * EmptyLeafNode is used to represent all empty children. It is instantiated at
 * the beginning of the program and exists until the end of execution.
 * 
 * SequenceLeafNode - This node stores a DNA sequence and is the only type of
 * non-empty leaf node. A tree begins with a single SequenceLeafNode. This is
 * the only type of node that can be inserted or deleted by a command.
 * 
 * The tree's hierarchy is similar to that of a trie. All the descendants of a
 * node have a common prefix of the DNA sequence associated with that node. As
 * sequences are insert into the tree each InternalNode looks at the next
 * character (starting from the first) in the sequence to determine which child
 * to insert into. All tree operations are implemented recursively.
 * 
 * Tree commands are implemented using the {@link Command} interface using the
 * "command design pattern". The {@link Command#execute(Node)} method is passed
 * the root of the tree to call call one of the recursive operations on. A file
 * containing a sequence of commands is converted to a Command objects and
 * stored in a queue. This structure encapsulates the functionality and
 * resources required to execute an arbitrary list of commands.
 * 
 * == USAGE ==
 * 
 * P2 <command-file>
 * 
 * == COMMAND FILE ==
 * 
 * The command file contains a list of commands and sequences descriptors to
 * control the DNA tree operations. The valid commands are defined in the
 * following section. Sequences described in commands must only contain
 * characters in the DNA alphabet (A, C, G, T). The parser is tolerant of spaces
 * or other whitespace in the command file, however commands are separated by
 * new line characters.
 * 
 * == COMMANDS ==
 * 
 * 1) insert <sequence-descriptor>
 * 
 * 2) remove <sequence-descriptor>
 * 
 * 3) print
 * 
 * 4) print lengths
 * 
 * 5) print stats
 * 
 * 6) search <sequence-descriptor>
